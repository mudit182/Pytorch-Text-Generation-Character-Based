This is a character level text generation model using a single layer of RNN/GRU (or alternatively LSTM) units.

The code is inspired from [tensorflow's guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation) but written with Pytorch.

TODO
- Add more comments to the main Jupyter notebook
- Improve text cleaning process in extract_from_pdfs Jupyter notebook
